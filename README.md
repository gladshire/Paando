Semblans is a tool that enables the automatic assembly of *de novo* transcriptomes for non-model organisms.

Through the collation of several external packages and the leveraging of C++ data streaming performance, Semblans streamlines the necessary pre-processing, quality control, assembly, and post-assembly steps, allowing a hands-off assembly process without loss to versatility. The following diagram shows a graphical workflow of the pipeline:
